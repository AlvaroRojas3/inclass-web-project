    <h1> Welcome To My Personal Profile! </h1>

    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Alvaro Rojas but my friends call me Al. <br> I'm a 25 year old Chilean/American attending my 2nd semester here at Weber State University as a Computer Science student. <br> I'm an Air Force veteran who recently completed his 4 year contract as a Medic and Instructor. <br> I made an important decision to join in 2020 as I was not sure exactly what I wanted to do after high school and wanted to leave my small town in Idaho Falls, Idaho. <br> Once I signed my contract and completed Basic Military Traning "aka BMT", I was selected to become a trained Dental Laboratory Technician. <br> However, once the Covid - 19 epademic began, I was later re-trained as an emergency combat medic later that year. <br> Most of my adult life was spent under intense training, long hours, and countless trails. <br> On the other hand, however, I also got to expirience a lot of the world, met amazing mentors alongside friends, and have become confident in my ability to tackle difficult things. <br> I now begin my journey to become a computer scientist and aspire to work in the software engineering world!

    <h2> Awards </h2>
    <p>
        During my time in military service, I have had many opportunities to shine. <br>
        One of my proudest accomplished awards was when I recieved my TCCC (Tactical Combat Casualty Care) Award and Instructor Certification. <br>
        This award is given to individuals who complete a tough mental/physical team course that puts them in simulated combat scenarios while learning how to apply life-saving measures to critically injured soldiers. <br>
        This specific life-saving course quickly became a required course in the Air Force due to its effectiveness and deployment capabilities. <br>
        So much so that I was selected to become an instructor, alongside other highly accomplished Airmen, to train up to 1,200 individuals who were set for deployment in 2024. <br>
        The task took 9 months but after all the traning was completed, I personally recieved acknowledgement from our base commander and was awarded Airman of the Year in 2023. <br>
        A title that only the people who go above and beyond mission standards get to receive. <br>
        As it still hangs proudly in my office, I continue to live life in a way that resembles recieving such an award. Never-ending hunger for improvement.

    <h2> Hobbies </h2>
    <p>
        I have a lot of hobbies I enjoy getting into but most of them primarily align themselves to whatever time of the year it is. <br> However there are some hobbies that I enjoy doing all year long. Some of these hobbies include: <br> </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Going to the gym and track</li>
            <li>Playing video games with my friends</li>
            <li>Cooking and learning new meals</li>
            <li>Expiriencing new ways to improve my learning </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Working out is pretty self-explanatory as my health has always had to be in top shape to progress within the military ranks. <br> It has now become one of my daily activities to forget about the world and let go of my frustrations/grievances. <br>
        <br>
        For my video games, my favorite game is called "Call of Duty". If you don't happen to know what that is, it is a military-style first-person shooter. <br> It allows you to get into a squad with your friends and battle it out using a variety of different weapons and skill sets. <br>
        <br>
        Cooking was always something I was surrounded with as my mother would cook homemade meals almost every single day. <br> Once I began living on my own and had to handle all of life's expenses, I came to realize how important cooking is as a skill. <br> It's not only useful and cooking your favorite foods but also saves a lot of money in the process. <br>
        <br>
        Learning-wise, I have always enjoyed reading a lot of sci-fi and fantasy books. <br> My love for reading action-packed world-building books became suprisingly helpful. <br> Especially when I started my educational journey at Weber State University. <br> My vocabulary was already on a higher level and it was a lot easier to grasp more complicated concepts because of all the reading that I had done in my younger years. <br> Now whenever I'm able, I look for ways to not only improve just my academics but also every aspect of my life.  </p>
