    <h1>CS2350: Client-Side Web Development</h1>

    <h2>HTML5</h2>
        <p>HTML5 was created as a markup language for presenting and structuring hypertext documents on the World Wide Web. It has since progressed into the current specialization we now know as HTML5 Living standard. Its maintenance is overviewed by the Web Hypertext Application Technology group ("aka" WHATWG), a pool of major browser vendors like Apple, Google, and Microsoft. The major goal of HTML5 was to improve the language with the support of the latest multimedia and updated features. HTML5 would make it so it would be more readable to humans and be consistently understood by devices and computers such as web browsers, parsers, etc.., and to remain backward compatible with older software. HTML5 was also made to encompass all previous out-of-date software, making it one of the best tools to use for Web Development.</p>
    
    <h2>CSS3</h2>
        <p>CSS3 or Cascading Style Sheets Level 3 is a language used to specify the presentation and styling of a document when it is coded in a markup language such as HTML5. CSS3 is the 3rd level of CSS as it has been upgraded over time. It is considered one of the three cornerstones of technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and javascript. CSS3's main function is to enable the separation of the content and the presentation by making modifications to the font, layout, and colors. This separation that CSS3 has provides more flexibility, control, and accessibility without concern for the presentation.</p>

    <h2>Java Script</h2>
        <p>Javascript is a programming language and a core technology of the World Wide Web. It is a high-level programming language that has dynamic typing, prototype-based object orientation, and first-class functions. JavaScrpt is also a multi-paradigm, meaning it can support event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. JavaScirpt also uses Application Programming Interfaces ("aka" API), to work with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structuring, and the Document Object Model. Although Java and JavaScrpt have similar names, their syntax alongside their respective libraries are quite distinct and differ greatly in how you design.</p>
